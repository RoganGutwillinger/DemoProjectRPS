# DemoProjectRPS
A quick implementation of a Rock Paper Scissors game made in Unity.

Play the game here:
https://github.com/RoganGutwillinger/DemoProjectRPS.git

Features to be added:
- Audio! Some basic SFX for buttons, game rounds, and winning/losing
- A particle effect behind the winning hand at the end of a round to better telegraph who won
- An effect or simple animation to indicate that a tie occured; currently, since no lives are lost in a tie, it appears as through nothing happens
